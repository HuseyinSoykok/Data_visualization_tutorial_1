Got it — I kept your code exactly as-is and only added concise, helpful comments to guide students while you live-explain.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--
This is a template for an html webpage. You can open it by opening the file in your browser.
The information in the <head> determines some of the meta data of a page. E.g. encoding, title, device
-->
<head>
  <!--
    The <meta> description is used by search engines and link previews.
    Keep it short (≈150–160 chars).
  -->
  <meta name="description" content="Webpage description goes here" />
  <!-- Character encoding: UTF-8 is the modern default and supports most languages. -->
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <!-- The <title> is shown in the browser tab and used by bookmarks. -->
  <title>Hello world</title>
  <!--
    Responsive viewport: ensures proper sizing on phones/tablets.
    Without this, mobile browsers may scale/zoom the page oddly.
  -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <!-- Simple author meta tag (optional). -->
  <meta name="author" content="Markus Wallinger">

  <!--
    The cascading style sheets (CSS) partitions the actual structure of the webpage from the style.
    You could also set styles inline (style="...") or in a <style> tag, but a separate file scales better.

    CSS format refresher:

      selector {
        property-1: value;
        property-2: value;
      }

    Common selectors:
      .className  -> targets elements with class="className"
      #idName     -> targets the single element with id="idName"
      tagName     -> targets all <tagName> elements (e.g., p, h1, div)

    Specificity (who wins when rules conflict) roughly:
      inline style > #id > .class > tag
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
  
<!-- Single-line comment: use comments to annotate code without affecting layout. -->

<!--
  h1 is the top-level heading. In modern documents, prefer one <h1> per page,
  and then use <h2>, <h3>, ... inside sections if needed.
-->
<h1 id="my-headline">
This is a headline of our page
</h1>

<!--
  <p> creates a paragraph block with margin in default browser styles.
  Note: plain text outside <p> is still valid HTML, but it won't receive paragraph spacing.
-->
<p>
  there should be some spacing now for this paragrpah
</p>

<!--
  The following two lines are text nodes outside a <p>.
  Browsers collapse consecutive whitespace, so “line breaks” in source don’t produce visible spacing.
  Use <br> for a single line break, or wrap text in <p> for paragraphs.
-->
And here is some text that should be a paragraph
there should be line break

<!--
  A <div> is a generic block container.
  id="my-container" (ID) should be unique on the page and is great for JS hooks or one-off styles.
  class="simple-container" (CLASS) can be reused across many elements to share styles.
-->
<div id="my-container" class="simple-container">
  <h1>
    This is a headline of our page
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      there should be some spacing now for this paragrpah
    </p>
    And here is some text that should be a paragraph
    there should be line break
</div>

<!--
  Multiple classes can be space-separated. Here: "simple-container" plus "large-margin".
  In CSS you might have:
    .simple-container { padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ddd; }
    .large-margin { margin: 2rem; }
  Combining classes composes styles.
-->
<div class="simple-container large-margin">
  <h1>
    This is a headline of our page
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      there should be some spacing now for this paragrpah
    </p>
    And here is some text that should be a paragraph
    there should be line break
</div>

<!--
  <script> at the end of <body> allows the HTML above to load before JS runs,
  which avoids “element not found” errors without needing DOMContentLoaded listeners.

  Typical next steps you might demo here:
    // Select by ID (unique)
    // const el = document.getElementById('my-headline');
    // el.textContent = 'Updated via JavaScript';

    // Select by class (may return many)
    // document.querySelectorAll('.simple-container').forEach(d => d.style.background = '#f9f9f9');

    // Add/remove a class to toggle styles defined in CSS
    // document.getElementById('my-container').classList.toggle('large-margin');
-->
<script>
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
